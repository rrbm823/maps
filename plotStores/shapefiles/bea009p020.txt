  Description:
    Abstract:  
      This map layer portrays 2004-2008 per capita personal income, annual 
      number of full-time and part-time jobs, average wage per job in dollars, 
      population, and per capita number of jobs for counties in the United 
      States.  

      Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of 
      the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the 
      county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used 
      in the computation.  

      The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all 
      jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness 
      service and paid employment of prisoners.  The jobs are counted at equal 
      weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all 
      included.  Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included.
      
      Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the   
      number of wage and salary jobs in the county.  Wage and salary 
      disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including 
      the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses; 
      and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the   
      employees of restaurants.  It reflects the amount of payments disbursed, 
      but not necessarily earned during the year.

      Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of 
      full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident 
      population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population 
      estimates were used in the computation. 

      All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.
